# Filos
By July 2022, there are already more than 83 million people who have created unique Bitcoin wallets on Blockchain.com. A staggering 89% of American adults have heard of Bitcoin, but only 24% of Americans said they understand how cryptocurrency works. Millions of tweets and news are generated per day on Web3, but it is not easy for users to digest the vast quantity of information, and many of them are not even free on Web2. There are also thousands of DeFi in different blockchains, it is not easy to understand each of them. Understanding data from Web2 and Web3 has been a big challenge. Few protocols aggregate Web3 data and provide users a unique platform to visualize and analyze its data. Even fewer protocols allow users to manage their portfolios automatically and easily. Filos integrates AI and blockchain to rebuild finance, providing a community-focused decentralized platform. Our platform applies data analysis to Web3, helping users better manage their portfolios. Filos is designed to allow every user to participate and manage their portfolio easily without any tech barrier. To achieve this goal, our team will start from Ergo and Cardano, and ultimately will expand it to multiple chains like ETH, DOT, etc.
