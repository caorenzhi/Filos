# Filos
By July 2022, there are already more than 83 million people who have created unique Bitcoin wallets on Blockchain.com. A staggering 89% of American adults have heard of Bitcoin, but only 24% of Americans said they understand how cryptocurrency works. Millions of tweets and news are generated per day, but it is not easy for users to digest the vast quantity of information, and many of them are not even free. One of the big chanllenges is to access the data, understand the data and visualize the data. Why this is a big chanllenge? Because in the Web 2, users provide their data and get the "free" service from the companies, and the companies will directly or indirectly use the data from the users. While those centralized company made the profit on the data provided by user, the users didn't own their data. Because of the blockchain technique, new protocols can be created on the new infrastructure that can provide decentralized service to web users, and users can provide the data but at the same time, they also own their data, and they will own the network by owning the coin in the network. 

Filos is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is member-owned communities without centralized leadership. It is designed to lower the barrier of users to access, understand, visualize the data in a decentralized way. It is an AI-powered Web3 portfolio management platform that will rebuild the finance to make it easy for everyone to manage their portfolio without any tech barrier. 

To achive this goal, Filos will utilize the Artificila Intelligence and Blockchain technology. Starting from Ergo and Cardano, and ultimately will expand to multiple chains like ETH, DOT, etc. Confucius said in the Analects - Yan Yuan that "all men are brothers“, we believe members in Filos are in a family, are friends, and will achieve the goal together. The rest of the white paper will go over the work that the team has done, the framework, and the roadmap. 

# Preliminary work
The team has done some preliminary work on the financial data sourcing and data analysis on the finanial. For example, more than **8k stocks pricing data, 1k Crypto price data, 10 million twitter data related to Crypto**. We have also build the discord bot to provide the analysis and access of those data to our members in the DAO. The team is also working on Crypto news data and analysis. In the near future, the team will train the AI model to process those data and members in the DAO can also access those analysis. All of those will be available on discord, in addition, the future reward and governance would be discord as well. Some examples are **NLP-based data inquiry, token authentication system, and community data participation framework**. 

# Filos framework
There are a lot of difficulties for data analysis on financial data, especially on the Crypto data. Just list a few, Crypto markets are more sensitive and volatile than the stock market, and traditional strategies don’t work well; Resources about understanding trends in the crypto markets are disjointed and inaccessible; There is a current lack of mature automated and easy-to-use crypto trading tools that can help people with managing their portfolios; Very little tooling in recognizing cross-chain opportunities. 
In order to tackle those difficult problems, Filos would integrate the Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and block chain technology.

Users can interact with the Filos platform which is AI powered, for the stock anlysis and recommendation, crypto analysis and recommendation, NFT and DeFi market analysis and recommendation, Crypto news sentiment analysis, etc. The AI can consider multiple variables, building more complex models than traditional strategies to make the decision more precise, and the AI model is built and tested on the data so it is more objective compared to human. In addition, AI can automatically find out the opportunities and manage the portfolio for the users, so that users don't need to sit in front of the computer 24 hours a day. 

In addition, the Filos platform will be open to all users who want to explore their own investment strategies and benchmark their strategies, and it will provide the financial data and analysis for users easily, largely lower the barrier of accessing data for users who don't have tech background. 

There are four main parts for the Filos platform. 

(1). **Data module in Web 2 and Web 3**

Filos platform will provide the easy to use product for users to access data, analyze and visualize data in Web 2 and Web 3. The data can be the social media data like twitter's data, financial data like crypto market and stock market data, or the financial news, etc. In addition, it also include the data in Web 3, like different DeFi data, NFT data, and other on-chain data. 

The AI and NLP technology would be used to process and analyze the data in Web 2 and Web 3.

(2). **Education in Web 3**

We believe the education is crucial in Web 3, unfortunately, a lot of users enter the Web 3 world with no idea what is DeFi, what is blockchain, what is AI, etc. It is not only important for the investors, but also the next generations, like undergraduate students, high school students, especially for women and underrepresented students. 

One product that Filos will bring is the Soul bounded NFT to education, while the concept of Sould bounded NFT is proposed by Vitalik Buterin, founder of Etheruem. Users can provide the Web 3 education in Filos platform, and they can also learn block chain and Web 3 easily in the Filos platform, and they can also earn tokens during this process (The so called play to learn and earn). The Soul bounded NFT would be their identity in Web 3, just like your ID or the CV in Web 2 (e.g., linkedin?). Every user would have the unique Soul bounded NFT, which is based on their experience on Filos platform. It would represent how the users use the product, the knowledge of the users in Web 3, etc. We want to bring the real utility of NFT, instead of any speculation.

(3). **Decentralized AI powered portofolio management**

We believe the decentralized AI would be the key for the portofolio management, as the AI can automatically process and analyze the data 24 hours a day, and it is also much faster than human. Ultimately, all data would be stored on chain and the AI model would also be stored on chain, to make it transparent and accessable to everyone. 

(4). **Governance**

As a DAO, the governance is very important. Filos would give the voting power to each user who holds the token of the network. In addition, Filos would also propose the staking & conviction vote concept, while users can lock their tokens for staking reward and also vote with the conviction so that they would have higher voting power. For example, one user A who has 100 token would have 100 voting power, and another user B who has 1k token would have 1k voting power, so the user B would always win in the governance for the future of the DAO, but with the conviction, user A can lock the token for 3 months for 30x voting power and earn the staking reward, but user B didn't lock his token. So finally user A's voting power is 100x30 = 3000, much higher than user B with only 1000. 

The Filos protocol would like to have every user participate and it will evolve with the governmance. So users can make proposal to decide which AI model would be used for the portfolio management, users can make proposal and decide which data should be analyzed, users can make proposal and decide which assets and which chain would be included in the portfolio, etc.
